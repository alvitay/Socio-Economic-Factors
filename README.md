# Socio-economic Factors for Geographic Clustering - README

## Context
The study of socio-economic factors plays a crucial role in understanding and shaping the future of societies. Various government and non-government institutions focus on these factors to influence policy and development. While GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is widely used as a measure of economic growth, it is not the sole determinant of a nation's economic health. This case study aims to analyze a dataset containing various socio-economic attributes of countries around the world to identify clusters of countries with similar socio-economic characteristics.

## Objective
The objective of this analysis is to determine if there are clusters of countries that share similar socio-economic profiles. Clustering countries based on these socio-economic factors can provide insights into regional or global trends and allow for better policy-making, resource allocation, and international cooperation.

## Dataset
The dataset contains several socio-economic attributes for different countries, which will be used for clustering analysis. These attributes represent key socio-economic indicators for each country.

### Data Dictionary
- **country**: The name of the country.
- **child_mort**: The mortality rate of children under 5 years of age, per 1000 live births.
- **exports**: Exports as a percentage of GDP per capita.
- **health**: Total spending on health, given as a percentage of GDP.
- **imports**: The value of imports as a percentage of GDP per capita.
- **income**: The net income per person in the country.
- **inflation**: The inflation rate, expressed as a percentage.
- **life_expec**: The average life expectancy in years.
- **total_fer**: The fertility rate, representing the average number of children per woman.
- **gdpp**: The GDP per capita, a measure of the average economic output per person.

## Approach
The goal is to perform clustering analysis on this dataset to identify groups of countries that exhibit similar socio-economic characteristics. The process typically involves:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handling missing values.
   - Normalizing or standardizing the data to ensure all attributes are on a similar scale, as clustering algorithms are sensitive to varying scales.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizing key socio-economic factors to understand their distribution and correlations between attributes.
   
3. **Clustering**:
   - Applying clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering) to group countries based on the socio-economic factors.
   - Evaluating the optimal number of clusters using methods such as the Elbow method, Silhouette score, etc.

4. **Cluster Interpretation**:
   - Analyzing the socio-economic characteristics of each cluster.
   - Identifying meaningful patterns and trends in the resulting clusters.

5. **Actionable Insights**:
   - Drawing conclusions about which countries belong to similar socio-economic clusters.
   - Offering recommendations for policy-makers, development organizations, or governments based on the clusters identified.

## Expected Outcome
- Identification of distinct clusters of countries with similar socio-economic characteristics.
- Insights into how these clusters can be leveraged for more informed decision-making in areas such as international aid, resource allocation, and policy development.

## Files in the Project
- **dataset.csv**: The dataset containing socio-economic attributes for various countries, with the columns described in the data dictionary.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Clustering Algorithms**: K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise), etc.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Elbow Method, Silhouette Score, and other cluster validation techniques.
- **Visualization**: Scatter plots, pair plots, cluster plots, and other techniques to visualize socio-economic clusters.
